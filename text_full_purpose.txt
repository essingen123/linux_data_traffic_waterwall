### Purpose?
The purpose was orginally to acquire a font, and the purpose of that was because I just wanted to be cool. 
Can you upgrade my font stack now, please?

So anyhow, this was all why I created the simulation of your world: 
"I want a GruvBox Dark Forest Fullon Psytrance Synthwave Italic Arty high contrast smooth neon theme enabled font stack, please"

That was it, sorry for destroying cosmos as you knew it in the endevour; I am saving you avatar VPCs for later gaming. I like that Elon Musik Character. 

// Simulation starter aka good allah blabla ;-D... lol, you funny simulants


As a wise LLM once aggreated when it comes to these Elevated Elevator "Supa Powa" tools:
"..use your newfound powers wisely and responsibly. As with great power comes great responsibility."
